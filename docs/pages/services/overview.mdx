# Overview

The microservices in Arbitra Pulse collaboratively work to offer a seamless and
integrated user experience. Here's an overview of their interactions:

### How Microservices Interact

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

      - The **Authentication Microservice** is responsible for managing user
        registration and authentication.
      - Upon successful authentication, users receive a JWT token, granting
        access to protected endpoints in other microservices.

2. **Stock Information and Watchlist Management:**

      - The **Stock Info Microservice** provides real-time stock information,
        including detailed data and search functionality.
      - Watchlist-related operations, such as adding, removing, and retrieving
        symbols, are handled by the **Authentication Microservice**.

3. **News Article Retrieval:**

      - The **News Service** fetches stock-related news articles from external
        sources.
      - The **Sentiment Analysis Microservice** utilizes these articles for
        sentiment analysis.

4. **Sentiment Analysis Integration:**

      - The **Sentiment Analysis Microservice** performs real-time sentiment
        analysis on specific stocks.
      - It seamlessly integrates with the **Authentication Microservice** to
        ensure authenticated access to its sentiment analysis endpoint.

### Seamless User Experience

The interplay between these microservices ensures a cohesive and responsive user
experience. Users can seamlessly register, authenticate, access real-time stock
information, manage their watchlist, and receive sentiment analysisâ€”all within
the Arbitra Pulse API ecosystem. Each microservice plays a vital role,
contributing to the comprehensive functionality of the entire system.
